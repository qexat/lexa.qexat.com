        I have always been an observer of the world. Silent, my eyes fixed on a
        person or object in my surroundings, trying to imagine what could have
        led the object of my contemplation to be in that precise place. The only
        thing that always eluded me was the glimmer on the horizon. In the
        biting cold of winter, sitting on the bench, I dreamed of what I already
        saw. Regularly, a pang of longing would arise from my desire to be on
        the other side of this world. It would have been a lie to say that I
        didn't want to be the one being observed. However, my choices and my
        constraints led me to this place, imprisoned by loneliness and the
        conviction that I couldn't escape.

        I don't know if I'm too young to have so many regrets. I know others
        with wounds just as deep, if not deeper. In the past, I thought
        complaining was something I had to earn, and that I had to suffer quite
        a bit to be able to do it. When the moment finally came in my life when
        I realized the absurdity of this belief that had gripped me all these
        years, I imagined I could sweep it aside and start doing things right.

        Time is something ignoble. Impartial. Often, I wish it would pass
        quickly, but more critically, I wish it would slow down. It seems so
        uncontrollable, even though it's only one axis of perception of the
        incredibly complex world around me. Very often, I am my own prison. But
        there are certain shackles that free me from punishments that only
        disappear when I accept that I will suffer them for eternity. For all
        these days, so few and so many, bad, delicious, mediocre, profoundly
        boring, exciting, which will flow over my powerless and finite body
        which will give back to the earth the nutrients it entrusted to me.
